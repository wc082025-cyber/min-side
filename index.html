<!-- general thoughts on the project. 
 Altered Beast is originally 
 an arcade game from  1988 and was ported to the
 console SEGA Mega Drive in Europe in september 1990.

 the purpose of this project was both to go depeer in HTML and CSS,
 trying to understand what those tools can do.
 While i have used AI (copilot) as guidance in this project, its sole 
 purpose was to help me understand what i can build, how i can build it
 and troubleshoot when something was out of my realm of understanding.
 While also diving back in my childhoos memories, 
 and dipping a toe in to the early and lawless cyberspace of the 90´s,

 The reasong behind Altered Beast specifically is a few.
The page was originally designed to be an age restricted page,
but while tinkering, it developed a deeper meaning.
The nostalgia is one thing, but also the design has a meaning as a beginner.
Choosing a color palette, design and functionality not only resembling the 90´s
but embracing the crude and deliberatly simple design.
A 90´s CEO competing with Nintendo, trying to be the edgy younger brother if you will.

The color palette is carefully chosen by only using colors from the image.
Harsh contrasts was the way of the decade. Apple had not yet layed down
the standard for beutiful design, flickering and attention grabbing
was the way to go.
